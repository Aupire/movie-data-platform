# Movie Data Platform

This repository is the foundation of a long-term data engineering project.

The current codebase focuses on:
- project architecture
- logging & configuration
- CI/CD pipeline setup

Business logic (scraping, ingestion, analytics) will be progressively added.

The goal is to build a production-grade movie data platform inspired by real-world data systems.
